# SSource-Monitor 1.0


+ Open-Source 


+ Usage:

   A simple python script that monitors the activity of a
   STATIC web page and if it notices any kind of change 
   in the source code, it saves the new source code.


+ Specifics:

   -REQUIRES Python 2.7

   -When I say "monitors", I mean it continuously requests the page's source code.

   -When I say static, I mean a web page whose source doesn't change every second.

   -It runs in the background (but can be changed by making it a .py)

   -It is NOT user friendly as you may notice.


+ Future plans:

   -Make it user frendly :)

   -Save just the change of the source code.


+ Further notes:

   It's not such a useful project, so I m not giving it that much of attention :) .




How to run:

1) Edit SSource-Monitor.pyw

2) Change the variables as you please.

3) Save changs and run the .pyw

4) To stop it, terminate the process in the task manager OR run it in a window (.py instead of .pyw)
